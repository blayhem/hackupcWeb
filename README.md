# HEATIT

Most of the planner apps recommend you content.

We provide you with the places where people really are, for each day of the week and each hour, in order for you **to choose which ones to go**.

The idea is simple: you select a day of the week and a time slice, and you get a **heatmap powered by [CARTO](https://carto.com)** with the areas where there are more people at that time.

This may help you identify which are the best places in town to go out (so many people can't be wrong, right?).

**[Altran](http://www.altran.com) provided us with a huga dataset** of locations in time which helped us make predictions based on previous data.
